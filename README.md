# artificial_neural_networks
This repository explores topics related to artificial neural networks. Each topic directory contains a writeup describing what was done
to explore the topic. In addition, the code and input files are also provided if you want to run the scripts yourself. The code in 
this repository is not as well documented as in the computer vision repository but the writeups should help give context to what
each file is being used for.
